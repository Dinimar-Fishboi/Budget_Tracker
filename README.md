## Installation

To use the app on your personal device, clone this repo and deploy the database to an online server to store your data once you are online. We’ve used MongoAtlas connected to Heroku – then you should be able to download the app to your personal device.

## Usage

When entering data, there are different buttons for Adding and Subtraction. Negative numbers won't work - don't use them.
You can take this app along with you on your device and upload data offline. The App will sync with your online application once the app recognises that the user is online.

## Tests

Check out the demo on our [live application :)](https://boiling-brook-13121.herokuapp.com)
